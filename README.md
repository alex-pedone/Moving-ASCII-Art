# How to use
to start, open a terminal and run "python -m http.server 8000".
this will allow you to view the image with the html file.
Next, run the main.rs script.
Finally, open the html file and you will be able to view the ASCII art.

To add custom images, just drop the image into the project folder, set the image name in the script, then run the script.
